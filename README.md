Problem Statement    
In this age of change, everyone knows that not only we can study the subjects we want to know by attending class but also by studying online course. Now we are living in the situation of Stay Home because of Covid-19, it is not convenient to attend class, so it is the best to study online course at home. With just the Internet, we can study in peace and quiet at home.  
  
 
Marketing Plan 
  
How can we get income from online courses?  In this age of IT, 
there are many ways to get income from online business. There is no 
marketing plan in this project as a free course yet. If we want to earn 
money, charge a fee from students.
